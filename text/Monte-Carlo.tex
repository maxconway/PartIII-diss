Techniques to compare the output of multi-objective optimization algorithms is an area of active research. 
Ultimately, one cannot definitively say that pareto front A is better than pareto front B unless every point in B is dominated by a point in A.

One relatively common metric for comparison of pareto fronts is the hypervolume enclosed by the front.
This enclosed hypervolume is smaller than the volume behind a hypersurface fitted to the front (see diagram), which meant that the typical technique of fitting a curve to the pareto front and integrating this curve was inappropriate. Instead, I wrote a custom Monte Carlo integration function, which would work out the actual dominated area, while exploiting the performance advantages of Monte-Carlo techniques to allow for efficient use even on extremely large fronts.
