\section{Embedded code}
The Knitr~\ref{Xie2011} dynamic report generation packages has been used to embed chunks of R code into this document, which shows the analysis conducted, and generates the graphs and tables that are included.
This means that everything is consistently up to date, and enables the reader to follow the reasoning used, and to understand in more detail any areas that interest them.
Obviously data files cannot be contained here, and some of the more mundane data handling scripts are also omitted. These can be found at \todo{put stuff online}.
The code chunks inserted are by no means necessary to understanding this document, they can be ignored or alternatively, a version with them removed is available at \todo{insert url}.
