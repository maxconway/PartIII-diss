This dissertation describes the use of genetic design algorithms to create strains of the bacteria Geobacter Sulfurreducens and Metallireducens which exhibit increased ability to produce electricity. 
A maximum production of \SI{104}{\percent} of wild type production was achieved.

In addition to the engineered strains themselves, the properties of the genetic design algorithms themselves are investigated, and genes and reactions associated with electricity production are identified.
