This dissertation describes the use of genetic design algorithms to create strains of the bacteria Geobacter Sulfurreducens and Metallireducens which exhibit increased ability to produce electricity. 
A maximum electricity production of \SI{104}{\percent} of the wild type value was achieved.

With the help of data from the Lovley Lab, at the University of Massachusetts, the biology of these strains was examined, to identify genes and reactions of special interest.

In addition to the engineered strains themselves, the properties of the genetic design algorithms themselves are investigated, and genes and reactions associated with electricity production are identified.
